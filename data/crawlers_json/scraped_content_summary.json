However, the future of AI extends beyond the digital space into the physical world, driven by robotics. This new frontier, known as “Physical AI,” involves AI systems that can function in the real world and comprehend physical laws. This marks a notable transition from AI models confined to digital environments. Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centred world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments.\\nThis course provides an in-depth exploration of humanoid robotics, focusing on the integration of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System), Gazebo Robot Simulator, and NVIDIA Isaac™ AI robot development platform. Students will learn to design, simulate, and deploy advanced humanoid robots capable of natural interactions.

However, the future of AI extends beyond the digital space into the physical world, driven by robotics. This new frontier, known as “Physical AI,” involves AI systems that can function in the real world and comprehend physical laws. This marks a notable transition from AI models confined to digital environments. Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centred world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments.\\nThis course provides an in-depth exploration of humanoid robotics, focusing on the integration of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System), Gazebo Robot Simulator, and NVIDIA Isaac™ AI robot development platform. Students will learn to design, simulate, and deploy advanced humanoid robots capable of natural interactions. The curriculum covers essential topics such as ROS 2 for robotic control, simulations with Gazebo and Unity, and using OpenAI’s GPT models for conversational AI. Through practical projects and real-world applications, students will develop the skills needed to drive innovation in humanoid robotics.\nUnderstand the fundamentals of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.\nUse ROS 2 for controlling humanoid robots.\nSimulate robotics systems with Gazebo and Unity.\nDevelop AI-powered robots using NVIDIA Isaac™.\nIntegrate OpenAI’s GPT models for conversational AI in robots.\nDesign, simulate, and deploy advanced humanoid robots.\nApply practical skills to real-world humanoid robotics challenges.\n[AI-101: Modern AI Python Programming](https://panaversity.org/flagship-program/courses/AI-101)\n**Note:** These prerequisites provide essential knowledge for success in this course.

The course covers everything from the fundamentals to advanced concepts, ensuring students acquire both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.</p>\n<p>The journey begins with an introduction to LLMs, focusing on their architecture, capabilities, and the specific features of Meta LLaMA 3. Next, the course dives into PyTorch fundamentals, teaching students how to perform basic operations with tensors and build simple neural networks. This foundation is crucial for understanding the mechanics behind LLMs. Data preparation is a crucial aspect of training models. The course covers comprehensive data collection and preprocessing techniques, such as tokenization and text normalisation. These steps are essential for preparing datasets suitable for fine-tuning LLMs like Meta LLaMA 3. Through practical exercises, students learn how to handle and preprocess various types of text data, ensuring they can prepare their datasets for optimal model performance.</p>\n<p>Fine-tuning Meta LLaMA 3.2 with PyTorch forms a significant part of the course. Students will delve into the architecture of Meta LLaMA 3, learn how to load pre-trained models, and apply fine-tuning techniques.

The course covers everything from the fundamentals to advanced concepts, ensuring students acquire both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.\nThe journey begins with an introduction to LLMs, focusing on their architecture, capabilities, and the specific features of Meta LLaMA 3. Next, the course dives into PyTorch fundamentals, teaching students how to perform basic operations with tensors and build simple neural networks. This foundation is crucial for understanding the mechanics behind LLMs. Data preparation is a crucial aspect of training models. The course covers comprehensive data collection and preprocessing techniques, such as tokenization and text normalisation. These steps are essential for preparing datasets suitable for fine-tuning LLMs like Meta LLaMA 3. Through practical exercises, students learn how to handle and preprocess various types of text data, ensuring they can prepare their datasets for optimal model performance.\nFine-tuning Meta LLaMA 3.2 with PyTorch forms a significant part of the course. Students will delve into the architecture of Meta LLaMA 3, learn how to load pre-trained models, and apply fine-tuning techniques. The course covers advanced topics such as regularisation and optimization strategies to enhance model performance. Practical sessions guide students through the entire fine-tuning process on custom datasets, emphasising best practices and troubleshooting techniques.\nA critical aspect of this course is its focus on cloud-native training and deployment using Nvidia NIM.
