However, the future of AI extends beyond the digital space into the physical world, driven by robotics. This new frontier, known as “Physical AI,” involves AI systems that can function in the real world and comprehend physical laws. This marks a notable transition from AI models confined to digital environments. Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centred world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments.",

Next, the course dives into PyTorch fundamentals, teaching students how to perform basic operations with tensors and build simple neural networks. This foundation is crucial for understanding the mechanics behind LLMs. Data preparation is a crucial aspect of training models. The course covers comprehensive data collection and preprocessing techniques, such as tokenization and text normalisation. These steps are essential for preparing datasets suitable for fine-tuning LLMs like Meta LLaMA 3. Through practical exercises, students learn how to handle and preprocess various types of text data, ensuring they can prepare their datasets for optimal model performance.

Fine-tuning Meta LLaMA 3.2 with PyTorch forms a significant part of the course. Students will delve into the architecture of Meta LLaMA 3, learn how to load pre-trained models, and apply fine-tuning techniques. The course covers advanced topics such as regularisation and optimization strategies to enhance model performance. Practical sessions guide students through the entire fine-tuning process on custom datasets, emphasising best practices and troubleshooting techniques. A critical aspect of this course is its focus on cloud-native training and deployment using Nvidia NIM. Furthermore, students learn how to deploy models using Docker and Kubernetes, set up monitoring and maintenance tools, and ensure their models are scalable and efficient.",

However, the future of AI extends beyond the digital space into the physical world, driven by robotics. This new frontier, known as “Physical AI,” involves AI systems that can function in the real world and comprehend physical laws. This marks a notable transition from AI models confined to digital environments. Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centred world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments.",

Next, the course dives into PyTorch fundamentals, teaching students how to perform basic operations with tensors and build simple neural networks. This foundation is crucial for understanding the mechanics behind LLMs. Data preparation is a crucial aspect of training models. The course covers comprehensive data collection and preprocessing techniques, such as tokenization and text normalisation. These steps are essential for preparing datasets suitable for fine-tuning LLMs like Meta LLaMA 3. Through practical exercises, students learn how to handle and preprocess various types of text data, ensuring they can prepare their datasets for optimal model performance.
